<p><em><strong>Kena: Bridge of Spirits</strong></em>&nbsp;is a 2021&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action-adventure_game">action-adventure</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game">video game</a>&nbsp;developed and published by Ember Lab. The story follows Kena, a young&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_guide">spirit guide</a>&nbsp;who uses her magical abilities to help deceased people move from the physical to the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_world_(Spiritualism)">spirit world</a>. The game is presented through a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-person_view">third-person perspective</a>. The player uses Kena&#8217;s staff for attacking enemies, and her pulse ability for defending against attacks. They are tasked with collecting small spirit companions known as the Rot, who help to complete tasks and battle against enemies.</p>



<p>The game&#8217;s development was led by brothers Mike and Josh Grier, founders of Ember Lab. Having spent five years creating commercials and branded applications, the development team shifted to creating an original video game after 2016. They partnered with&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Interactive_Entertainment">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a>&nbsp;for a console-exclusive deal, and grew the team to 15 core employees. The game&#8217;s art was created in collaboration with Vietnamese animation studio&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparx_Animation_Studios">Sparx</a>, and its fictional world is inspired by Eastern locations such as&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan">Japan</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali">Bali</a>. The original score was composed by Jason Gallaty, who collaborated with Balinese ensemble group Gamelan Çudamani to create&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamelan">gamelan</a>&nbsp;music respectful to the culture.</p>



<p><em>Kena: Bridge of Spirits</em>&nbsp;was showcased at the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribeca_Film_Festival">Tribeca Film Festival</a>&nbsp;in 2021. Following some delays, partly due to the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic</a>, the game was released on September 21, 2021, for&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_4">PlayStation 4</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5">PlayStation 5</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows">Windows</a>. It received generally positive reviews, with particular praise directed at its artistic design, original music, and the use of the Rot; critics were divided on the gameplay, narrative, and characters. It received several awards and nominations from&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game_publication">video game publications</a>&nbsp;and awards ceremonies.</p>
